Topic:  Static Analysis and Model Checking
(mainly CBMC)

CBMC can be found at www.cprover.org/cbmc

Tasks:

- Present 1 research paper on static analysis or model checking in class (25%)

- Assignment to verify/find bug in real code using CBMC

- Project -- either survey of an important static analysis/model
  checking topic, a small research project, or a more ambitious
  verification with CBMC

ASSIGNMENT 1 DETAILS:

-- Install and make sure you can run the latest CBMC.

-- Find a (small, for your sake) C program (or function) online that
   implements something easy to explain and specify.  You can write
   one.  The code should be at least 50LOC and non-trivial (e.g., you
   can't prove a swap function correct) -- at least one loop,
   preferably.

-- Write a harness that would be used to look for bugs in this code.

-- If the code is correct, introduce some bugs in the code, preferably
   subtle ones that might easily escape a decent test suite.  Check
   this -- does your harness find these bugs?

-- Write up your results: was the program correct or buggy?  What was
   hard to specify?  Was there functionality you could not specify?
   How long did it take to verify with different loop bounds?  How did
   turning on/off bounds and pointer checker affect cbmc runtime?
   Discuss the ability of the harness to find the bugs you introduced,
   and how to address the problem if it did not, including (if
   possible) a revised harness to find them.  Minimum of 400 words.

DUE DATE: April 21, 2015 (before class)
